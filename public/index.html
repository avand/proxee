    <h1>Welcome to Proxee</h1>

    <p>
      Proxee is an HTTP proxy built by <a href="http://avandamiri.com">
      Avand Amiri</a>. The original inspiration for it was to allow his
      front-end web development students to work around the single-origin
      policy. But it's designed to proxy any HTTP request.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>
      To proxy an HTTP GET request, simply perform a GET to
      <code>proxy.avandamiri.com/get</code> with the <code>url</code> query string
      parameter set to the URL you're trying to access. Here's an example:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
      http://proxy.avandamiri.com/get?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      What the hell is <code>%3a%sf%sf</code>?
      When you pass a parameter to the server via query parameters (the
      stuff that comes after the <code>?</code>) you have to "escape" it.
      That just means that certain characters need to be swapped out. For
      example, <code>%3a</code> is simply <code>:</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don't have to do this manually though. Just use the
      <code>escape()</code> method that's built into your browser. So,
      for example:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
      var sourceURL = "http://my.api.com/path?query=kitties";
      var proxyURL = "http://proxy.avandamiri.com/get?url=" + escape(sourceURL);
    </code></pre>
  </body>
